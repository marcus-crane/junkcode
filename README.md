# junkcode

This repo is inspired by [Andrew Tridgell's own junkcode repo](https://github.com/tridge/junkcode).

You can read the explainer behind it in tridge's original talk [here](http://samba.org/ftp/tridge/talks/junkcode.pdf).

Each folder comes with its own repo listing the original repo creation and push dates for old repos.

Going forward, it'll just list when a folder was first created since most of that detail is recorded with each commit anyway.
