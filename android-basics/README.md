# Android Basics

At the moment, I'm going through Google's Android Basics courses on Udacity and these are my working files.

They aren't important enough that they should deserve their own repos so each folder in the root directory contains an Android Studio project.

# Resources

You can find all of featured courses [here](https://developers.google.com/training/android/).

I've started with the "For new programmers" section as while I'm not a new programmer as such, I'm having to learn Java from scratch.

Here are links to the courses that make up the [Android Basics Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-basics-nanodegree-by-google--nd803) because Udacity isn't fun to navigate around:

- [Android Basics: User Interface](https://www.udacity.com/courses/android-basics-user-interface--ud834)
- [Android Basics: User Input](https://www.udacity.com/courses/android-basics-user-input--ud836)
- [Android Basics: Multiscreen Apps](https://www.udacity.com/courses/android-basics-multiscreen-apps--ud839)
- [Android Basics: Networking](https://www.udacity.com/courses/android-basics-networking--ud843)
- [Android Basics: Data Storage](https://www.udacity.com/courses/android-basics-data-storage--ud845)

**Note that while the Nanodegree program mentions paying $100/month, that's for the fluff like being able to get feedback and personalized support.**

The actual courses, linked above, are completely free so just ignore the nanodegree page itself.

# Those are long courses?!

Nah, the estimates are pretty misleading!

For example, the first course estimates 2 weeks(!) while I plowed through it in like 7 or 8 hours across 2 days.

The further you get in (and build up a list of resources), the more you'll slow down of course.
