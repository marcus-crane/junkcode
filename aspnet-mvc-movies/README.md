# ASP.NET Movies viewer

I wrote this for a Junior C# interview once following along with a Microsoft guide but customising it.

I probably don't remember what most of this does (and I don't even have a Windows install to use it)

P.S. Visual Studio Preview for Mac will render this different than the actual Visual Studio for Windows and probably not compile it either
