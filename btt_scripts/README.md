# BetterTouchTool Scripts

I've been playing around with the touch bar on my work laptop and start using BetterTouchTool. It's pretty cool but there's some features I could add that're a bit more specific to what I'm after.

## Outages

Current outages are listed in a work slack channel so I threw together a quick script to regex the "channel purpose" for the number of incidents. The length of the incident array is then output onto my touch bar so I can see at a glance how many incidents are open. It's pretty neat!

## Trakt

I often scrobble TV series to Trakt as I watch them via my Plex media server so the Trakt script polls for that and displays the show I'm currently watching. It's useful if I haven't been keeping track of where I'm at.
