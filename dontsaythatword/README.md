### Stop saying that

A silly script I left running for like 5 minutes once that just replied to mentions saying "Stop that" if they say a word like "Poop" or "Dumb" at you.

Doesn't have any actual use.

### Usage

Rename `example.env` to just `.env` and put your account keys in there.

You can find them at the [Developer Apps](https://apps.twitter.com) portion of [Twitter](https://twitter.com).

They've got guides on how to go through it and get your own keys.

Once that's in place, fill in the username you want to check (likely your own) and the word you want to look for.
