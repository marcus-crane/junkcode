# Client-side rendering with Hyperscript

This challenge is very similar to https://github.com/dev-academy-challenges/client-side except that it uses Hyperscript instead of Handlebars. They both operate on the idea of a component/template as a function of data that renders a user interface. These template engines differ in their interface and capability, but not in their output. Handlebars is logicless and Hyperscripts gives you the full power of JavaScript. It's good to explore both options.
