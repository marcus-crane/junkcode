                <h1>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</h1>

                <p>It's very much focused on providing not just programming experience but also providing an experience of the types of environments that we're likely to work in as well.</p>

                <p>I've encountered a few people skeptical of the bootcamp model, particularly overseas iterations but as far as I'm aware, EDA is unique in that they are partnered with industry icons such as Xero and TradeMe.</p>
                
                <h1>What are your impressions?</h1>
                
                <p>So far, EDA is matching up exactly to what I thought it would be. I appreciate how the intake acts as a reverse funnel starting off focused.</p>

                <p>As someone who has done a bit of web development as an on-off side hobby, I'm glad that I'll be able to revisit concepts that I'm aware of but perhaps haven't spent enough time fully understanding.</p>
                
                <h1>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h1>
                
                <p>Pretty well if I do say so myself. Admittedly I'm not a huge video chat fanatic so it'll take me a bit to get used to that but otherwise, I'm enjoying it. Having Slack on hand is hugely helpful since I know if I run into any bugs, I'll be able to get a helping hand there.</p>

                <h1>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h1>

                <p>Not particularly. I'd done quite a bit of research before hand so I had a very good idea of what I was getting into. That said, Phase 0 was what I was most unsure of but I'm glad to find it's all structured nicely so you know exactly what needs to be done each week.</p>

                <h1>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</h1>

                <p>Both, of course! I'd say the excitement comes out of the nervousness which is a good thing. It's easy to look where we'll likely end up and say "No way is that possible" but I'm sure we'll all be very happily surprised.</p>
