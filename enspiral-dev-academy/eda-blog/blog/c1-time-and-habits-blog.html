                <h1>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h1>

                <p>I was aware of the Pomodoro technique before EDA but I'd never really had anything suitable to try it with. So far, I've been doing alright but I'm sure next week I'll have more to add.</p>

                <h1>What did you find interesting?</h1>
                
                <p>The idea of doing a task or forming a habit and then having the mindset come afterwards is sort of surprising? I feel like I've had that happen before but because I'd never really thought about it, it's easy to forget how you acted before the change in mindset.</p>

                <h1>What worked for you?</h1>
                
                <p>So far, I haven't really needed to use anything to get started on the work. It's something that I've enjoyed on and off as a hobby anyway so getting back into it isn't too hard.</p>
                
                <p>Now that I think about it, I'm actually finding toggl itself it helping since you can see how much work you've already done.</p>

                <h1>Which will you experiment further with?</h1>

                <p>Although I'd never really considered meditation as something I would ever do, I think I'll give it a test run and see how things pan out. I'll also be trying out BJ Fogg's method of tying tiny habits to actions I already do daily.</p>
