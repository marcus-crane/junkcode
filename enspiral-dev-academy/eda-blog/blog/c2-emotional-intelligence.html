                <h1>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</h1>

                <p>My main takeaway from Chapter 1 of Search Inside Yourself was just how adaptable the brain is. A French scientist turned Tibetan Monk being the worlds happiest man? Who would have guessed!</p>

                <p>Admittedly, as someone who was once assigned to mental health services, I can say first hand just how important it is that we learn to observe how we think. If we dwell on the negative too much, it's amazing just how far, to the point of being borderline delusional, one can sink.</p>

                <p>I found Meng's introduction of the amygdala, the hair trigger for the fight or flight reflex, and the idea that it can be altered to be less sensitive to outside stressors to perhaps be the most interesting part. It's definitely something I'm looking forward to reading more about and I'm sure something that would prove invaluable going forward.</p>
                
                <h1>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</h1>
                
                <p>Seeing as I live near to a highway, it's not the easiest thing to pull off properly with the constant noise pollution outside. It is still fairly relaxing anyway although I found it took the first minute or so to get properly settled and then before I knew it, the time was up.</p>

                <p>I'm not too sure if the type of breathing would help. Normally, I associate meditation with "breathing in through the nose and exhaling through the mouth" which isn't something I do unless I conciously think about it. Ironically, for something that's meant to be about clearing the mind, I'm probably overthinking it!</p>
