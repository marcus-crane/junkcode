                <h1>How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</h1>

                <p>The main way that focusing on the process affected my rebuild was in that I was fine changing the design once I found certain things worked and others didn't. If I had been too focused on getting the exact product I thought of in the first place, it might have worked but ultimately, it wouldn't have felt like it evolved naturally the more I experimented.</p>

                <p>It also meant I wasn't too attached to what I was working towards. After the first two hours, I ended up stripping out the majority of my site and tidying it up. I might not have done that if I felt I needed to stick with the exact product I intended for.</p>
                
                <h1>What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2?</h1>
                
                <p>It's a way to calm the body and mind when you're overwhelmed with the stress of everyday life!</p>
                
                <h1>What new things have you learnt about meditation?</h1>
                
                <p>I was immpressed at the research between those who meditate and those who don't. Specifically, MRI brain scans of those who meditate having a thicker neo-cortex. There isn't necessarily a causation but there's still a correlation it seems.</p>

                <h1>Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?</h1>

                <p>The mountain posture felt quite good. Breathing in so that your rib cage rises then exhaling without changing the position of your spine so as to have the "flow of a river and the stability to a mountain."</p>

                <h1>Any other musings?</h1>

               	<p>I really liked the analogy of a bowl of water with silt in the bottom. When you're relaxed, the silt is at the bottom and the water is calm and clear. When you're alert (and stressed), the bowl is stirred clouding the water.</p>
