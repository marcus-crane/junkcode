                <h1>What did you learn from your mindfulness conversation?</h1>

                <p>It's really hard, at first anyway, to not want to add on to what someone else is saying. They might note something that happened and it's tempting to explain why that was or another similar thing they may find useful.</p>

                <h1>How did the other person find it?</h1>
                
                <p>They appreciated looping since you generally don't get to hear how what you said transferred across to the other person. It also gives a chance to make sure you've grasped what they were trying to get across in the way that they wanted.</p>
                
                <h1>Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?</h1>
                
                <p>Doing less than you can do is properly a good way to think about things in general to make sure they don't begin to feel like a chore. It doesn't mean take it easy either, though!</p>
