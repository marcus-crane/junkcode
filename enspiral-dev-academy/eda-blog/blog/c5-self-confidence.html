                <h1>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</h1>
                <p>Self-awareness is the idea of being aware of how you are in your present state. It's almost like being able to take a third person view of yourself and having a greater awareness of your own behaviours.</p>
                <p>Mindfulness, is very similar although it is more about being able to perceive your mental state, accepting and, possibly then altering it if it is not beneficial (eg; feeling down, etc)</p>
                <h1>I heard you tried out journaling? How was it?</h1>
                <p>Well, actually, I'll go about this in reverse. I was actually doing daily journalling since the start of the year up until about two weeks ago when I would miss a few days here and there.</p>
                <p>Sometimes, earlier in the year, I might miss a day but then fill in two entries but at the moment, I've got a gap of about two weeks.</p>
                <p>I've found that when I was journalling, it definitely feels like you're offloading your thoughts about situations in a place that you can always come back to in the future but for the present, it's sorted away and you can forget about it</p>
                <p>In the time that I haven't been doing that however, it feels like there's almost a backlog of things to think about since I haven't been able to offload any of it.</p>
                <p>Looks like it'll be time to catch up and get back into the routine of it!</p>
                <h1>What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?</h1>
                <p>The example used in the book was anger and I've always felt like I've handled that pretty well. There have been plenty of times where I'll experience anger but not feel a need to express it because I can see how it would and wouldn't benefit me.</p>
                <p>I'll be looking forward to broadening it out in future chapters if it pops up though. I would be a very useful tool for the various other emotions!</p>
