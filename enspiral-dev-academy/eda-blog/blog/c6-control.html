                <h1>What learnings did you take from Chapter 5 of Search Inside Yourself?</h1>

                <p>There were a lot of good bits on triggers. A lot of the examples were geared toward anger but there was a few good ones on panic attacks too.</p>
                <p>One particular example was about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yongey_Mingyur_Rinpoche">Mingyur Rinpoche</a>, who is a Nepalese teacher and master of two lineages of Tibetan Buddhism, according to Wikipedia. They never really stated who he was until I looked him up just now!</p>
                <p>Up until he was 13 years old, he would have panic attacks seemingly at random. While on a meditation retreat, he looked deep into his panic and realised that neither following nor ignoring it would stop its growth.</p>
                <p>Instead, he began to treat it like a friend, letting it enter and acknowledging its presence but never wishing it to go away</p>
                <p>Within a mere 3 days, he found that it disappeared completely! He said that in the time he spend thinking about his emotions, he had a greater realisation of how "feeble and transitory" his emotions were.</p>
