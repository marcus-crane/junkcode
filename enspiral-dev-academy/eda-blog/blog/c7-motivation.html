                <h1>How does life look through the 'Pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?</h1>

                <p>The thinking behind pleasure, passion and purpose is to define three different types of happiness. Pleasure is happiness that isn't sustainable such as purchasing a new gadget on a whim or spluring on a vacation. They're strong feelings at the time but ultimately, they pass quickly.</p>

                <p>Passion is the middle of the bunch. You may be passionate towards your hobbies but they aren't necessarily anything more than just that. Just something you enjoy but doesn't factor into the "bigger picture" of what you believe in and want to work towards.</p>

                <p>Finally, we have purpose. The driving force, and motivator, that makes the difference between doing alright at a job and putting in 110% because you genuinely believe in the work you're doing. As far as happiness is concerned, if you feel you're attaining your purpose in your career or life in general, the sense of happiness will stick around for a long time.</p>
