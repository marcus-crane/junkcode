                <h1>Have you tried using any of the insight and techniques for growing trust and sincerity? How did it go?</h1>

                <p>Not yet but I'll have to keep it in mind!</p>

                <h1>How did you find the loving kindness meditation?</h1>

                <p>It's a good exercise to follow for those times where you have to remember that the other person is just a person like you, whether it be in times of conflict otherwise.</p>

                <p>I very recently had a situation that was somewhat similar where I met someone I'd looked up to as a kid and admired their work. Upon finally meeting them, it's tempting to build them up to being more than they are, having looked up to them, but really, they were just a person doing what they enjoyed, just as much as I was. I actually did say thought that they'd probably had the same kind of situation as I did when they were younger and met people they looked up to, haha.</p>

                <h1>Political Awareness Exercise</h1>

                <p>I've had similar encounters at my old job. Essentially, times where I would think that something my manager was doing was a waste of time, which it was really, but I knew from his side of things that it was protocol and he had little choice. We had a bunch of times like that, actually so it made for good practice.</p>
