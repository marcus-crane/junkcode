                <h1>What is your experience of compassionate (or not) leadership?</h1>

                <p>I've experienced a mix thanks to the joy of corporate heirarchies. Initially, both my manager and his were super compassionate people who genuinely believed they were no better employees than those of us at the entry level.</p>

                <p>Shortly, the head manager was moved to a different story and things started going downhill from there. Senior managers would move to different branches, fed up with the replacement head managers who were all generally angry and stressed out all the time.</p>

                <p>Eventually, junior managers were promoted then left and the whole thing just turned into a mess. No one had any true motivation anymore because they had no one to look up to and everyone above, at HQ level just seemed like they had no idea what they were truly doing.</p>

                <p>That and new managers would say the originals were lazy or incompetient. Sure, they weren't the hardest working people, physically, but they had all their processes down so they didn't need to. Things were good enough and honestly, better than the mess that it turned into (and thankfully, that I don't have to deal with anymore)</p>

                <h1>Do the multiplying goodness meditation and Tonglen meditation. How did you find it?</h1>

                <p>I found actually visualising the processes wasn't too hard but genuinely believing it is easier said than done. Perhaps I just need to spend more time working at it and meeting new people to get more from it.</p>

                <h1>How does the SCARF model apply to your Phase 0 experience so far? How will it apply to bootcamp?</h1>

                <p><i>Status: </i>As far as EDA goes, we should try our best to improve our person statuses, through learning and striving to do our best, given the circumstances but also, learn when to put status aside if we're stuck or need feedback on a project.</p>

                <p><i>Certainty: </i>Well, I can say certainty has been an issue for me during Phase 0. Since I'm moving 700 kilometers away from my home town to a city where I don't know anyone, want to get everything sorted has definitely been on my mind since last year. Everything from paying tuition to find a place to stay has all been finally sorted now so now all I have to worry about is learning!</p>

                <p><i>Autonomy: </i>I think I've managed my autonomy pretty well during Phase 0. There have been some things I could have done better but for the most part, things were fine. Bootcamp likely will be stressful but since everything is set up just for that to be the main focus, I think that'll be managable.</p>

                <p><i>Relatedness: </i>It'll be interesting to see how this pans out for bootcamp. Kea hasn't really had this problem since we've all had our slack channel and checkins but we'll soon be joining a second cohort who we've never met before.</p>

                <p><i>Fairness: </i>Having visited EDA before and met some of the organisers, I'm not worried about it being an unfair environment. While I haven't met most of the Keas in person yet, I think everyone comes across as fair people as well. After all, it isn't easy getting to this point!</p>
