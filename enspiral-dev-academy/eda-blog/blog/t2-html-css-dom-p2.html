                <h1>What is grid based design?</h1>

                <p>Grid based design feeds off the idea that all elements of a webpage are square. Using that knowledge, if we design our websites to take advantage of a grid like layout, it makes the whole website a lot more modular.</p>

                <p>It also makes the layout easier to browse for the user rather than having elements sprawled all over the page.</p>
                
                <h1>What's all the hype about responsive webpages?</h1>
                
                <p>Oooh! Responsive webpages are the hot new thing at the moment and for good reason. As smartphones became increasingly common, it used to be the standard that you would have two versions of the same website: one designed for your desktop/laptop and the other designed for your phone.</p>

                <p>As the range of screens increased, it became a mess to maintain more than one version and thanks to advances in CSS, we now have the ability to build responsive webpages.</p>
                
                <p>What that means is no matter the size of the screen you're on, designers can build their pages so that they scale to match the size of the browser in realtime. As the usable screen space shrinks, non-essential elements can be hidden or rearranged to provide the most optimal viewing experience.</p>
                
                <h1>What is semantic structure?</h1>
                
                <p>I think this is going to be one of those questions where I understand it better as I try to explain it! As I understand it, semantic structure refers to the heirarchy of tags in your HTML. For example, when using heading tags (h1, h2 etc), they should be used in order of heading importance and not just for visual effect. You wouldn't use a h2 tag in the middle of a paragraph just to bolden a certain word.</p>
                
                <p>Beyond code readability, there are a few other reasons why adhering to semantic structure is important. The main one is screen readers which, well, they read the screen, interpret it and output it as text to speech, braille or a variety of other forms for those who use accessibility tools.</p>

                <p>The other is search engine bots which scour pages and use semantic tags like headings and lists to determine the structure of a page. These sorts of tools ignore design so it's important that eg; headings aren't just paragraph tags with a 72 pt font but instead make use of proper structuring.</p>
