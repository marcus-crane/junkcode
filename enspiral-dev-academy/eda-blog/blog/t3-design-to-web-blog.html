                <h1>What is a responsive site and why is having one important?</h1>

                <p>Let's tackle what a responsive site is first. Why yes, it is indeed a website that responds! As you resize your browser, the website will scale up and down in size to take advantage of the available space.</p>

                <p>For users on mobile, where you don't have the precision of a mouse, the designer may have desktop navigation condense down into a pop up menu in order to make the best use of precious screen real estate.</p>
                
                <h1>What is mobile first design and why is it important?</h1>
                
                <p>Due to the sudden uptake in smartphones over the past 10 years, more and more users are spending their time browsing the web on their phones rather than on the desktop.</p>

                <p>Traditionally, site designers would address these two different platforms by having two versions of the same site: one for mobile and one for desktop. As sites grew bigger and more complex, the task of maintaining two seperate versions of the page grew to be a huge pain in the butt.</p>

                <p>Thanks to advancements in browsers and the revamping of HTML guidelines, we now design for mobile first. We start with the smallest possible browser size, in this case a phone and ensure that we can relay all the necessary information. Once we know the site works with a small screen size, we can expand upon it and polish it up for desktop viewers. This way, we know that no user will be left behind with a sub par experience. You can sleep well at night knowing your site is accessible on the 2cm LED screen that'll be embedded in your future WiFi toaster.</p>
                
                <h1>What are frameworks and what are their pros and cons?</h1>
                
                <p>Much like a house, you start with the skeleton and build on top. Frameworks are like a sort of pre-built skeleton for your site that provides a stable foundation to build from.</p>

                <p>Browsers can treat the same pages different, measuring font sizes, margins and a lot of other attributes in completely different ways. A skeleton will usually set all of those to the same standard to eliminate as many inconsistencies as possible.</p>

                <p>They also tend to come with a bunch of preset styles so you can save time by not having to pretty up your buttons and tables.</p>

                <p>On the downside, you may find that since it's easier to implement things like flexible columns and what not, that you don't actually begin to understand how those things work. The more that is already provided for you, the less you have to struggled with and learn to understand.</p>

                <p>The other main issue with frameworks is page speed. While not a huge issue for CSS, if you aren't using the majority of what a framework provides, the browser is still going to need to load in all of the different stylings provided regardless.</p>

                <h1>What is a wireframe and why do we use them?</h1>

                <p>Wireframes are like the blueprints to your building site. By planning out what you're going to build first, you'll have a clearer idea of what you're trying to build and where to put everything instead of just fiddling around for hours on end trying to come up with ideas.</p>

                <p>They're also important to have if you're designing for a client. They may want to see what ideas you have first before signing off the start of your site build. Gotta have something to show them since they've come to you to make sense of a site. They won't necessarily understand any technical terms but everyone can understand images.</p>

                <h1>What aspects of your wireframe did you find difficult to implement?</h1>
                
                <p>Originally, I was going to have a div for questions and a div for answers unlike the single div with styled text I opted for the in the end. The issue I ran into was getting the alignment to alternate between left and right without the left divs popping up along side the right ones. In the end, I opted to simplify my design and use text instead.</p>

                <p>I was also going to have my social icons on the right side of the banner but I couldn't get them to sit nicely in a way that looked nice. They just looked out of place and distracted from the design.</p>

                <p>Although my wireframe was fairly simple, I should have spent more time thinking about my design before hand. In saying that though, my idea of what I wanted to make only really came about the more I fiddled with things trying to get them to work.</p>
