                <h1>How does Javascript compare to HTML and CSS?</h1>

                <p>If HTML is your house and CSS are the wallpaper, decorations etc then Javascript is the wiring that makes your lights work. There's definitely a lot more logic involved but it allows for some pretty powerful stuff.</p>

                <p>I'd have to say changing elements in the browser without refreshing the page is definitely one of the coolest features possible with Javascript!</p>

                <h1>What are control flow and loops?</h1>
                
                <p>Control flow refers to the order that code is executed, much like how CSS is cascading. You can't just have things executing without checking for the proper prerequisites first.</p>

                <p>Control flow is most prevalent in Javascript when using things like if/else statements. You first want to check IF something is true before you decided what ELSE should happen.</p>

                <p>If you have to go do some errands (your ELSE), you'd first check IF you have enough fuel. If you do, things are fine, otherwise IF you don't have enough, first you'd refuel. Imagine if you skipped IF everytime just jumping straight to your ELSE everytime. You'd run out of gas!</p>

                <p>Loops are, well, loops! A loop will keep repeating a command assigned to it for a set period of time. It can be for a set period of time eg; 10 cycles of the loop or even an unknown number of times. You might want a loop to keep running until a certain condition changes in your program. They're also useful for condensing down code that might only have one element change.</p>

                <h1>What's the difference between accessing data from arrays and object literals?</h1>
                
                <p>I'd have to say the main difference between arrays and objects are order. Arrays have a beginning, starting at position 0, 1, 2 up to the end. Objects, unlike arrays, don't and the contents can be accessed in any order.</p>

                <p>Arrays have their uses for storing data in a table like form but they can get out of control when it comes to large amount of data.</p>

                <p>Objects can be as expansive as a complicated array while still being a lot more readable to humans. It's also a lot easier to call specific bits of information at a glance.</p>

                <h1>What are functions and why are they useful?</h1>

                <p>A function is a piece of code that is able to be "called". You might have a list of commands that you want to perform over and over with different variables. With a function, you can write out the command once and then just call that function repeatedly slotting in different variables each time.</p>
