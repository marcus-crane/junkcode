                <h1>What is scope?</h1>

                <p>When you have a value or expression, scope refers to the context in which said values and expressions are visible.</p>

                <p>Let's say I have the following piece of code:</p>
                <pre><code>function returnDog() {
    var animal = "dog";
    return animal;
}</code></pre>
            <p>The <code>animal</code> variable is defined inside the <code>returnDog()</code> function. When run, <code>returnDog()</code> will return the value of <code>animal</code> which in this case is <code>"dog"</code></p>

            <p>Now what if I tried to change the value of <code>animal</code> to say, <code>"cat"</code>. You would think <code>returnDog()</code> would turn into some sort of <code>returnCat()</code> instead, right?</p>
            <pre><code>function returnDog() {
    var animal = "dog";
    return animal;
}

animal = "cat";

returnDog() // value is still "dog"
</code></pre>
            <p>But how is that?! We changed the animal variable to <code>"cat"</code> right before we called the function!</p>

            <p>That's where scope comes in. The animal variable contained within <code>returnDog()</code> is only visible to the other parts of the code within the function.</p>

            <p>What ends up happening is that we've defined two lots of <code>animal</code> variables. One is within the function which contains the value of <code>"dog"</code> and the other sits outside of the function with the value of <code>"cat"</code>.</p>

            <p>Since functions only exist as they're being called, the animal variable within <code>returnDog()</code> is able to exist seperately from any other potential variables. It's possible to have hundreds of <code>animal</code>variables within hundreds of functions (although why would you) since they'd never interact with one another.</p>

            <p>While you can't alter variables declared within functions from the outside, you can do the reverse.</p>

            <pre><code>i = 0;
function count() {
    j = " is a number";
    return i + j;
}</code></pre>

            <p>This code would return <code>"0 is a number"</code>.</p>

            <p>From within <code>count()</code>, I could set <code>i</code> equal to <code>"hotdogs"</code> and we could get <code>"hotdogs is a number"</code> as a result.</p>

            <p>We could then set <code>j</code> to equal <code>" are a food"</code> so that our code makes a bit more sense</p>

            <p>Due to Javascript scope however, while <code>j</code> would still be equal to <code>" are a food"</code>, once we run <code>count()</code>, the output would be the same as we are left with two different <code>j</code> variables: once outside the function and one within it.</p>

            <p>The same applies to functions within functions and so on. Scope works from the present level upwards.</p>

            <p>Hopefully that all made sense!</p>
