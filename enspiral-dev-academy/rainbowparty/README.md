### Rainbow Party

[Eugene](https://github.com/data-doge), former EDA grad and teacher created [meowtown](http://meowtown.herokuapp.com/cats), a quirky project where once an animal has been visited 100 times, it's deleted from the database.

One of our tasks was to recreate it using Node which I did then I realised that I could repurpose it to store some of my favourite colours. Mind you, this is before I discovered [Sip](http://sipapp.io/)

I like how it turned out and it was a good lesson in deployment using Heroku.
