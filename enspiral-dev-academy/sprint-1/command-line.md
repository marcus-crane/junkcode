What is the command line?
-------------------------

The command line is an application that lets a user operate their computer purely with text. While it may seem easiest to just use the visual interface available, the command line can prove invaluable when wanting to navigate directories and run commands at a fast pace.

Command List
------------

ls is used to output a list of files and folders in the current directory.

cd is used to change the current directory. It can be used to navigate up or down one level at a time or you can navigate to specific locations eg; cd ../travelling/pretty/far/away

mkdir is used to create new directories. Quite simply what it says on the tin.

pwd, short for print working directory, is used to output the current directory to the command line. It's useful if you've lost track of where you are!

rm is used to remove files and folders. Alternatively, rmdir can be used specifically to remove directories.

mv is used to move files to different locations. It can also be used to rename files if the start and end location of the file is exactly the same.

hostname outputs the host name of the computer you are currently on. It's handy if you're networking your computer and forget the name of it.

cat is used for concatenation. Basically a fancy term that means to join two things together. For example, if you had two text files, one containing "This phrase has" and the other containing, "been joined together." then concatenating them would create one single file that says "This phrase has been joined together.".

more is used to view the contents of a file without modifying it.

chmod is used to alter the permissions of a file and also, which users may access said file. There are multiple sets of permissions ranging from no access to letting the user read, write and execute said file.
