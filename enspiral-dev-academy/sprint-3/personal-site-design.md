What is your site's primary purpose?
---
At present, the primary purpose of my site will be to host the EDA blogs that we are writing each week.

Who is your target audience?
---
My target audience for this site is other cohort members, future cohorts and perhaps anyone else interested in EDA who may happen to come across student work that is still deciding whether to join EDA.

How do you want site visitors to interact with your site? What experience would you like them to have?
---
The intended experience will be pretty simplistic. Visitors will first arrive at the index page and be presented with blog posts. There may be some extra social links that the visitor can check out but I don't want them to be overwhelmed with visual clutter.

How will you build your site to support your desired user experience?
---
In order to keep the experience simple and clean, I'll be making use of whitespace. As of yet, I intend to use a single column layout so that attention isn't spread across the page. I'll be making use of the skeleton framework and responsive design so that the site makes the best use of the varying levels of screen real estate.
