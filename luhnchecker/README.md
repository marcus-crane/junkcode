# Luhn Algorithm Checker (Python)

Created: 17th August 2017

This is a fun little implementation of the [Luhn Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm) in Python which I'm using more and more lately.

It's used to check if a credit card number is valid or not, and as I found out just as I was writing this, it also works for IMEI numbers and a bunch of other stuff. I just tried it on my phone's IMEI so it seems valid.

Eventually I might use this as a base for trying out making a python module but for now, it's just a real basic command line program.
