# mazecrawler

Created: 21st September 2017

This was a maze crawler program that I had to write for a job interview. The rules were that you couldn't consult any resources nor could you use an external editor.

Basically, just imagine a text box and that's about it.

I wrote it in Python as a personal challenge since normally I would use Javascript and it mostly worked.

I cleaned it up in the `maze_working.py` file but it still pretty buggy.
