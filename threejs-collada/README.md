# threejs-collada

Testing using ColladaLoader with three.js to load .dae 3D models

Place a .dae model in the /models folder and rename the inline script to fit the name of the .dae file

You also can't just load index.html unfortunately as it'll be considered cross origin (http:// and file://)

With Python 2.7, you can run serve the folder at `localhost:8000` like so: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`
