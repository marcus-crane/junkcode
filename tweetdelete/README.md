# tweetdelete

Created: 14th October 2017

A small program for searching my twitter archive and deleting old tweets that were in poor taste (ie: when I was in school/a teenager)

My first proper usage of the argparse module which was neat and I fiddled with the python-twitter module which is pretty neat. I now know csv.DictReader is a thing now too!

# Usage

Written against Python 3.6. You can install the requested modules with `pip install -r requirements.txt` or just `pip install python-twitter`.

You'll also need your Twitter archive (tweets.csv) which can be generated by visiting Settings when logged in.

Once you've done that, make a [Twitter app](https://apps.twitter.com) and insert your app + account keys into the `config.ini` file.

Make sure to rename `config.ex.ini` to `config.ini` as well.
